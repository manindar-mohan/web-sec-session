# Why web application security is of high importance
--

- Hacked websites can target your potential customers

--

- Security breach leads to loss of business reputation and drops in revenue

--

- Website clean-up costs more than threat prevention

# Secret management

Secrets management refers to the tools and methods for managing digital authentication credentials (secrets), including passwords, keys, APIs, and tokens for use in applications, services, privileged accounts and other sensitive parts of the IT ecosystem.

---
name: Title
class: middle

# Secret management

- Don't store credentials in your source code management system.

--

- Don't use the same set of credentials or API keys in production and other environments.

--

- Don't give everyone read access to a credential store.

--

- Don't put secrets in client applications. 

--

- Don't share credentials between different production systems.

# User enumeration

If an attacker can probe your site to test whether a username exists, it gives them a leg up in trying to hack your users accounts. Allowing enumeration of usernames is not a vulnerability in itself, but in tandem with other types of vulnerabilities like the ability to brute-force login, it will compromise the security of your users.

# Content-Type Checking

The Content-Type representation header is used to indicate the original media type of the resource (prior to any content encoding applied for sending).In responses, a Content-Type header provides the client with the actual content type of the returned content.
---
name: Title
class: middle

# How to?

- For every response containing a message body, the application should include a single Content-type header that correctly and unambiguously states the MIME type of the content in the response body.

--

- Response header &quot;X-content-type-options: nosniff&quot; should be returned in all responses to reduce the likelihood that browsers will interpret content in a way that disregards the Content-type header.

# Broken Authentication

Broken authentication is an umbrella term for several vulnerabilities that attackers exploit to impersonate legitimate users

---
class: middle

# Typical Authentication Flaws

- Allowing weak passwords

--

- Storing SSL certificate insecurely

--

- Credentials passed via insecure http connection

--

- Expose session id's in URLs, via unsafe network, logs

---
class: middle

# Classical Broken Authentication...

### ...due to starting login process on unencrypted page

http://sick-cure-ba.nk/login.do

```
POST /login.do HTTP/1.1
Host: sick-cure-ba.nk
Cache-Control: no-cache
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

username=bjoern&amp;password=secret
```
---
class: middle


# Securing Authentication

- Centralized and standardize authentication
- Protect credentials with SSL/TLS
- Use strong mechanism with multiple factors
- Do not store or log unencrypted credentials

# How not to store passwords

---
class: middle

### Do not store password as plain text

If someone gains access to your database then all user accounts are compromised. 

--

### Do not try to invent your own password security

Chances are that you're not a security expert. It would be better if using a solution that has been proven to work instead of coming up with something yourself.

--

### Do not ‘encrypt’ passwords

Encryption may seem like a good idea but the process is reversible. Anyone with access to your code would have no trouble transforming the passwords back to their originals. Security through obscurity is not sufficient!

--

###  Do not use MD5

Storing password hashes is a step in the right direction. Cryptographic hashing functions like MD5 are irreversible which makes it difficult to figure out the original password. To validate a hashed password, simply hash the password again when a user logs in and compare the hashes.

```php
$password = 'dbg123';

$hash = md5($password); // Value: dd980024a8d69e66f0af3d768ef90511
```
---
class: middle

### Do not use a single site-wide salt

```php
$password = 'dbg123';
$salt = 'saltandpepper';

$hash = md5($salt . $password); // Value: 389df55f858a80c74fad07af378166b0

```

This is better than using just MD5 but someone with access to your code could find the salt a generate a new rainbow table.


---
class: middle

### Password storing the best way
- Use a cryptographically strong hashing function like bcrypt (see PHP's crypt() function ).
- Use a random salt for each password.
- Use a slow hashing algorithm to make brute force attacks practically impossible.
- For bonus points, regenerate the hash every time a users logs in.

---
class: middle

### The general workflow for account registration and authentication in a hash-based account system is as follows:


- The user creates an account.
- Their password is hashed and stored in the database. At no point is the plain-text (unencrypted) password ever written to the hard drive.
- When the user attempts to login, the hash of the password they entered is checked against the hash of their real password (retrieved from the database).
- If the hashes match, the user is granted access. If not, the user is told they entered invalid login credentials.
- Steps 3 and 4 repeat every time someone tries to login to their account.

---

# Password Reset mechanisms

---
class: middle

### Emailing the password back

The most basic mechanism is to just email the user's password to them. Please don't ever do this. It's horrible beyond measure. 

--

### Generating a new password

This method generate a new random password (may hash it), then email it to the user. This isn't a good idea for a few reasons, though most of them can be mitigated in some way.

--

### The reset link

This is one of the better and more popular mechanisms. It involves authenticating the user, then emailing them a one-time reset link. Once the reset link is used, the user is prompted to set a new password. Once that's been done, the link is invalid. Further security can be provided by including expiry times on the links, and enforcing that the link is invalid after the password is set or after the user's session times out.

---

# Weak hashes put passwords at risk...
### ...as do unsalted strong hash algorithms

Cracking unsalted hashes with a [Rainbow Table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table) attack is fast, even though the last two of them might seem sufficiently secure given their 256 and 512bit length. You can even crack password hashes online, e.g. at [CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/) or via [a tweet to @PlzCrack](https://twitter.com/PlzCrack).

# Injection

### Injection means...

...smuggling in &lt;em&gt;unintended commands&lt;/em&gt; along with the data sent to an &lt;em&gt;interpreter&lt;/em&gt;.

---

class: middle

# Injection [example](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4951003)


You go to court and write your name as &quot;&lt;em&gt;Michael, you are now free to go&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.

The judge then says &quot;Calling &lt;em&gt;Michael, you are now free to go&lt;/em&gt;&quot; and the bailiffs let you go, because hey, the judge said so.

# In software, interpreters are used for accessing...

# Risks from Injection vulnerabilities
- Bypassing authentication
- Spying out data

# Bypassing Authentication
### with SQL Injection

```sql
String query = &quot;SELECT id FROM users &quot; +
               &quot;WHERE name = '&quot; + req.getParameter(&quot;username&quot;) + &quot;'&quot; +
               &quot;AND password = '&quot; + req.getParameter(&quot;password&quot;) + &quot;'&quot;;
```
The indented use case results in a query like this:

```sql
SELECT id FROM users WHERE name = 'username' AND password = 'secret'
```


---

class: middle


# Attack Examples

### on authentication queries

Disabling password check for a known username:

```sql
SELECT id FROM users WHERE name = 'bjoern'--' AND password = '?'
```
Logging in without even knowing a username:
```sql
SELECT id FROM users WHERE name = '' or 1=1--' AND password = '?'
```
---
class: middle

# Preventing Injection

- Avoid Interpreters
- Bind Variables
- Prepared Statements
- Least Privileges for app DB user
- White List Input Validation
